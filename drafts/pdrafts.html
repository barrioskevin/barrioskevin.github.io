<p>I have been studying at UNLV since August of 2019. Ever since I have been enrolled I have been studying
				   Computer Science. I knew that I wanted to study Computer Science since my freshman year of high school
				   and in my senior year I tried to apply to university. Unfortunatley at this time my high school
				   transcripts were not looking the best and I actually met none of the requirements to enter this school.
				   I remember visiting UNLV at an event called 'Rebel Preview' where high school students can come and 
				   experience what the campus was like before the school year started. I had never been to a college campus
				   but I knew that this was the place I wanted to be. At the event we got a chance to meet some academic
				   advisors that will help high school students transition to college students. When I got the chance to 
				   speak with my advisor and she seen that I didn't quite meet the requirements to enter she let me know
				   about a different way that I can get accepted. There is a college exam called the ACT, I took this
				   exam in my junior year of high school but I was 1 point off of getting and accepting score to UNLV.
				   My advisor noticed this and told us about an ACT exam that I can retake but that my score would only
				   apply to UNLV this is exam was called the ACT Residual Exam. After leaving that event I went home and
				   scheduled my ACT Residual Exam online, The test was an in person examination that I would take on the 
				   Paradise campus of UNLV. I had about 2 weeks from the moment I scheduled my exam to the actual exam
				   date. At this time I was still in my last few months of my senior year, but I knew that this was my
				   only chance to be able to go to University. I had spent these 2 weeks studying and preparing hard for
				   this exam. I felt like this was the first time in my life where I was actually studying hard and trying
				   to meet a goal for myself. I checked out ACT practice books from my high school's library and read each
				   section about how to prepare for the exam. There was tips for each section of the ACT and I went through
				   all of them. I took practice examinatons online from previous ACT exams. I would come home from school
				   everyday and go straight to studying. I remember one time my mom and my sister had both walked into my
				   room one evening when I was studying, I wasn't really leaving my room and they came in to talk to me 
				   about it since it was a concern. I explained to them how important this was to me and how I had to make
				   a passing score. When the day of my examination came up it was on a Friday from the morning to the
				   afternoon, I had class this day but I needed to get an excused abscence in order to go take my exam
				   at UNLV's Paradise Campus. When I got to my exam room there was a few other students there, they were
				   all different ages, I had never been in a test taking enviornmenet like this. The exam proctor gave us
				   a brief overview about the exam and how each section would be timed. I was feeling very nervous about
				   the exam but after we started I had no choice but to just try my best and go through the exam. When we
				   got half way through the exam we were given a small break where we could use that time to leave the room
				   and eat some snacks. I wanted no distractions during this time so I had just left the room and taken a 
				   little walk around the building. When we came back the second half of the exam started and although I
				   wasn't as nervous I also wasn't too confidence about my performance as I was going through each question.
				   Again, I had no choice but to do my best. Once the exam was over it was around 2pm. I was feeling really
				   down about the whole exam because in my head I believed that I didn't score as high as I needed to. 
				   I remember after walking out of the building the first thing I did was call my mom. I didn't even know
				   what I would tell her but I called her and let her know that I finished the test, she told me that no
				   matter what happens she was proud of me for trying so hard. I didn't know how I would feel if I didn't
				   make the passing score, I started to think about plans for my future that didn't involve University.
				   About 1 week later our scores were mailed to us in a letter. I remember getting the letter from the mail
				   and my mom was there when I opened it up. It was a single sheet showing your scores for each section of
				   the exam and one composite score. Previously when I took the ACT for the first time in my junior year I
				   had gotten a composite score of 21, to enter UNLV you needed a composite score of 22. I opened up the
				   letter and the first thing I saw was my score for each of the sections. I can't remember the exact score
				   for each section but my highest section was Math at 24. I got nervous looking at these scores since they
				   were very similar to my previous attempt, but then I look at the composite score written on the letter
				   and to my surprise I had actually reach a 22 composite score. This meant that I was eligble to enroll
				   at UNLV. I had so much exciement and I was really proud to show my mom. I immideatley took a photo of
				   this letter and emailed my academic advisor who was helping me enroll into UNLV, my adivsor was also
				   proud that I was able to reach the required score. I am really grateful for everything that had happened,
				   After graduting high school that year I had the privellege to start my new academic journey at UNLV with
				   a focus on Computer Science.</p>

				   I've been fascinated by coding ever since I was a child, though back then, I didn’t quite understand what it was. I spent much of my time on the computer, exploring various intriguing topics. My first exposure to the world of programming came when my brother introduced me to emulation. We downloaded emulators for consoles like the Game Boy Advance and played our favorite games, such as Pokémon, directly on the PC. While exploring these ROM files, I stumbled upon titles that weren’t official releases—games modified by others to change mechanics, gameplay, and storylines. This sparked my curiosity, and I became determined to learn how I could customize these ROMs myself. This was my entry point into the world of programming, where I learned about various tools that allowed me to make edits to Pokémon ROM files. I even created a YouTube video demonstrating how to add a custom Pokémon Trainer battle script to a ROM.

				   As I grew older, I discovered other software tools like RPG Maker and Game Maker Studio, which allowed me to build my own projects. I spent countless hours learning these tools, honing my problem-solving skills, and troubleshooting to create working projects. My interest in coding deepened in middle school when I became captivated by the game Minecraft. At that time, Minecraft was only available on PC and was written in Java. While I still didn’t fully grasp the concept of code, I wanted to host my own Minecraft server to play with friends. Following the instructions on the Minecraft website, I navigated the complexities of port forwarding and setting up Java files, formally introducing myself to coding. Successfully running my first server was a thrilling experience, and I soon began customizing it by downloading plugins and editing Java files to meet my personal needs.

				   In my freshman year of high school, I attended a magnet school where I took classes focused on Computer Science. This is where I gained foundational programming experience. In an introductory class, our teacher guided us through a C++ textbook, and we spent most of our time completing programming challenges at the end of each chapter. This course taught me the basics of writing code and how to operate an IDE—we used Code::Blocks. My first significant programming project was in this class. At the end of the year, we were tasked with creating our own programs, and I decided to make a hangman game using C++. It took a few weeks, and while it may not have been the best implementation, by the end of the class, I had a working hangman game that could even pull a random word from a text file.

				   After that year, I returned to my locally zoned school for the remainder of high school and didn’t continue my formal studies in programming until college. In college, C++ was the primary language taught in introductory courses, and I continued to improve my programming skills, learning more about what code could accomplish.

				   Since then, I’ve been consistently writing my own programs and creating projects, whether to solve problems, develop video games, or simply practice my skills. You can find a more comprehensive list of my projects [here].
