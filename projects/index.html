            showcasing my skills and interests. I aim to provide useful
            background and important information for each project. Pages here
            will be regularly updated and new pages may be added or removed

                A group project where we built a MVP (minimum viable product) of a social media application dedicated to UNLV. This project went on to be entered in our senior design competition. My team was made up of 6 students (including myself) where we competed against 10 other teams in the department of Computer Science. We went on to win first place for RebelHub! It was a lot of fun getting to experience colloborative development first hand for such a successful project.

                I wrote this program when I started to learn about functional programming. I really enjoyed learning about
                a different paradigm in programming because it introduced a whole new way of coming up with solutions to problems. I liked
                the principles of functional programming and decided to try my best to follow them as I coded a game of blackjack.
                The program lets you play multiple hands, place bets, double bets, split hands!, and even allows multiple players. 
                I tried to follow closely the rules you would find in a typical 3:2 double deck game.

                An attempt to represent graphs in cpp in order to run various
                algorithms and traversals. I made this project while I was taking a course in Analysis of Algorithms. I used this project
                to be able to implment various graph algorithms like Dijkstra's algorithm, Johnshon algorithm, Bellman Ford algorithm, and more!

                A simple snake game written in C using simple direct media
                layer 2.0. This was one the first iterations I did writing the game of snake. I beleive
                this is a classic game that almost all developers make at some point and this is my take on it.
