                A simple flappy bird clone written in PixelPad, a website for creating games using python. In this project I reuse objects keeping only
                a limited amount of pipes in memory. Instead of a bird you play as a taco. It was fun to code flappy bird as it was the first time that I did and I tried to come up with everything
                on my own as I learned more about python and using pixel pad.

              A group project where we built a MVP (minimum viable product) of a social media application dedicated to UNLV. This project went on to be entered in our senior design competition. My team was made up of 6 students (including myself) where we competed against 10 other teams in the department of Computer Science. <strong>We went on to win first place for RebelHub!</strong> It was a lot of fun getting to experience <strong>collaborative development</strong> first hand for such a successful project. I got to use a lot of cool technologies such as <strong>Next.js</strong> and <strong>Python Django</strong>. I got to experience what it's like to build a full stack application. Although it was a MVP, I feel like getting to work on an application like this helped me learn more about web development and sharpened my skills as a developer.

                I wrote this program when I started to learn about functional programming. I really enjoyed learning about
                a different paradigm in programming because it introduced a whole new way of coming up with solutions to problems. I liked
                the principles of functional programming and decided to try my best to follow them as I coded a game of blackjack.
                The program lets you play multiple hands, place bets, double bets, split hands!, and even allows multiple players. 
                I tried to follow closely the rules you would find in a typical 3:2 double deck game.

                I made this project while I was taking a course in Analysis of Algorithms. It was an attempt to represent graphs in cpp
                in order to run various algorithms and traversals. I created a useful structure for a graph that allowed for easily creating
                graphs and contained methods for retrieving information about the graph in various kinds of data structures (matrix, adj list, bool array).
                I used this project to be able to implment various graph algorithms like Dijkstra's algorithm, Johnshon algorithm, Bellman Ford algorithm, 
                and more! It was pretty useful to be able to take the graphs we would recieve in our homeworks or previous exams and be able to interact 
                with them programatically, I would be able to test my work more efficiently and it was nice to practice implementing fundamental graph 
                algorithms for myself as we learned them in class.

                A simple snake game written in C using simple direct media
                layer 2.0. This was one the first iterations I did writing the game of snake. I beleive
                this is a classic game that almost all developers make at some point and this is my take on it. I got
                to try using SDL for the first time and I started to research understand more about game development.
