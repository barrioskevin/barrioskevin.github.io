          <p>
            Below you will find a selection of projects I've worked on
            showcasing my skills and interests. I aim to provide useful
            background and important information for each project. Pages here
            will be regularly updated and new pages may be added or removed
            throughout the future. I apprectiate you taking the time to visit
            this page.

                  A group project where we built a MVP (minimum viable product) of a social media application dedicated to UNLV. This project went on to be entered in our senior design competition. My team was made up of 6 students (including myself) where we competed against 10 other teams in the department of Computer Science. We went on to win first place for RebelHub! It was a lot of fun getting to experience colloborative development first hand for such a successful project.

                  An attempt to represent graphs in cpp in order to run various
                  algorithms and traversals. I made this project while I was taking a course in Analysis of Algorithms. I used this project
                  to be able to implment various graph algorithms like Dijkstra's algorithm, Johnshon algorithm, Bellman Ford algorithm, and more!

                  A simple snake game written in C using simple direct media
                  layer 2.0. This was one the first iterations I did writing the game of snake. I beleive
                  this is a classic game that almost all developers make at some point and this is my take on it.
