                My name is Kevin Jason Barrios, and I'm a 23-year-old from North
                Las Vegas, Nevada. I recently completed my Bachelors of Science
                in Computer Science at the University of Nevada Las Vegas, in
                December 2024. As I finished my final semesters at UNLV, I look
                back and am grateful for the extensive knowledge and experiences
                that I've gained throughout my studies. I am proud to have been
                named to the Dean's Honor List in my Fall 2023 and Spring 2024
                semesters and finishing with a 3.4 GPA.
              </p>

              <p>
                In addtion to being a student I also work part time as a coding
                instuctor at The Coder School Las Vegas. At The Coder School I
                teach coding fundamentals to small groups of students, helping
                them build their programming skills and encouraging their
                interest in technology.
              </p>

              <p>
                I consider myself a problem solver who enjoys finding innovative
                and efficient solutions to challenges. Ever since I was little I
                have been attracted to computers and have spent most of my years
                experimenting with different machines. The idea of software as
                digital tools designed to solve real-world problems has always
                facinated me. As I've grown older I have been dedicated to
                honing my skills as a developer so that I'm able to contribute
                to meaningful software throughout my future.

          <h2>UNLV</h2>
          <p>
            I have been studying at the University of Nevada Las Vegas, since
            August 2019 with the focus on Computer Science. My journey to UNLV
            wasn't straightforward. In highscool I knew that I wanted to study
            Computer Science but at the time my grades didn't meet the admision
            requirements. Despite this, I attended an event called 'Rebel
            Preview' where high school students could experience the campus
            before the school year started. It was my first time visiting a
            college campus, and I knew instantly that this was where I wanted to
            be.
          </p>
          <p>
            During this event, I met with an academic advisor who noticed that I
            didn't quite meet the requirements for admission. She informed me
            about an alternate path: retaking the ACT through the ACT Residual
            Exam, a version of the test whose score would only apply to UNLV. I
            had taken the ACT in my junior year but missed the required score by
            just one point. This was my chance to make up for that.
          </p>
          <p>
            With only two weeks to prepare, I threw myself into studying. I
            borrowed practice books from my school's library, took practice
            tests online, and focused intensely on improving my score. It was
            the first time in my life that I truly dedicated myself to achieving
            a goal.
          </p>
          <p>
            On the day of the exam, I was nervous but determined. The test was
            held on UNLV's Paradise campus, and I remember walking into the exam
            room with a handful of other students of all different ages. The
            proctor explained the process, and soon enough, the exam began. I
            did my best to stay focused but as I went through each section, I
            couldn't shake the feeling that I wasn't performing as well as I
            needed to. After completing the test I felt unsure about my
            performance and honestly quite down. I was convinced that I hand't
            scored high enough. I called my mom the first thing after walking
            out of the building, unsure of what to say. She reassured me that
            she was proud of me for trying so hard, no matter the outcome.
          </p>
          <p>
            A week later, my score arrived in the mail. My mom was with me when
            I opened the letter. I saw the scores for each section first, when I
            noticed that they seemed similar to my previous attempt my heart
            sank. But then I saw the composite score: 22. It was exactly what I
            needed to be eligible for admission to UNLV. I was overwhelmed with
            excitement and relief. I immediately shared the news with my
            advisor, who was thrilled for me and helped me walk though the
            remaining steps for my admission.
          </p>
          <p>
            This experience taught me the value of perseverance and hard work.
            Since then, I've been fully commited to my studies at UNLV and I'm
            grateful for the opportunity to pursue my passion for Computer
            Science.

          <h2>Work Experience</h2>
          <p>
            I have been working since I was 15 years old, starting with my first
            job at Carl's Jr. Over the years, I've worked in various food
            establishments, gaining valuable experience in fast-paced
            enviornments that require strong customer service skills. I enjoyed
            working these roles because they allowed me to interact diretcly
            with customers and see the immediate impact my team had on each
            order.
          </p>
          <p>
            In 2020, I started a job working at a local food truck that was
            considerate of my commitment to school. Working here allowed me to
            focus more on my studies and achieve higher grades. I'm grateful for
            this job, as it enabled me to balance work and school effectively. I
            still occasionaly work and help out at the food truck, assisting
            with order management and customer service.
          </p>
          <p>
            Currently, I work part-time as a coding instructor at The Coder
            School Las Vegas, a role I started in October 2023. At The Coder
            School I conduct engaging coding classes for small groups of 4-7
            students in a classroom setting, with the focus on programming
            languages such as Python and JavaScript. I help ensure that each
            student receives personalized attention and guidance, helping them
            develop and complete coding projects with an emphasis on
            problem-solving skills and creativity.

          <h2>Background</h2>
          <p>
            I have been facinated by coding ever since I was a child, though
            back then, I didn't even know what code was. When I was younger I
            would spend most of my time on the computer, exploring various
            intersting topics. My first exposure to the world of programming
            came when my brother introduced me to emulation. We downloaded
            emulator for consoles like the Game Boy Advance and played our
            favorite games, such as Pokemon, directly on the PC. While exploring
            these ROM files, I stumbled upon titles that weren't official
            releases-games modified by others to change mechanics, gameplay, and
            storylines. Seeing all these different titles sparked my curiosity,
            and I wanted to learn how to make custom ROMs myself. This was my
            entry point into the world of programming, where I learned about
            various tools that allowed me to make edits to Pokemon ROM files. I
            would spend a lot of time just trying to make my own games and
            learning the capabilites of these different tools. I even created a
            YouTube video demonstrating how to add a custom Pokemon Trainer to a
            ROM file.
          </p>
          <p>
            As I grew older, I discovered different software tools such as RPG
            Maker and Game Maker Studio. I spent countless hours learning these
            tools, building my problem-solving skills, and troubleshooting my
            own projects. My intreset in coding deepend in middle school with
            the discorvery of a game called Minecraft which at the time existed
            only on PC and was written in Java. This game inspired me to set up
            and customize my own Minecraft server. In the process I learned
            about Java, port forwarding, and the very basics of managing a
            server.
          </p>
          <p>
            In my freshman year of highschool I went to a magnet school where I
            took classes focused on Computer Science. This is where I gained
            foundational programming experience and finally started to
            understand the concept of code. I wrote my first programs in this
            class, including a hangman game that could pull a random word from a
            text file. This class gave me my first real exposure to coding
            concepts and working in an IDE. After that year, I returned to my
            locally zoned school for the remainder of high school years and
            didn't continue my formal studies in programming until college.
          </p>
          <p>
            At university, I continued to improve my programming skills, with
            C++ was the primary language taught in introductory courses. I began
            learning deeper concepts of programming and through various
            assignements I was expanding my skills in different areas.
          </p>
          <p>
            Since then, I have been consistently writing my own programs and
            projects, whether to solve problems, develop video games, or simply
            practice my skills. You can find a more comprehensive list of my
            projects <a href="projects/index.html">here</a>.
