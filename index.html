                I consider myself a problem solver who enjoys finding innovative
                and efficient solutions to challenges. Ever since I was little I
                have been attracted to computers and have spent most of my years
                experimenting with different machines. The idea of software as
                digital tools designed to solve real-world problems has always
                fascinated me. As I've grown older I have been dedicated to
                honing my skills as a developer so that I'm able to contribute
                to meaningful software throughout my future.

          <h2>UNLV</h2>
          <p>
            I have been studying at the University of Nevada Las Vegas, since
            August 2019 with the focus on Computer Science. My journey to UNLV
            wasn't straightforward.
          </p>
          <p>
            In high shcool I knew that I wanted to study
            Computer Science but at the time my grades didn't meet the admission
            requirements. Despite this, I attended an event called 'Rebel
            Preview' where high school students could experience the campus
            before the school year started. It was my first time visiting a
            college campus, and I knew instantly that this was where I wanted to
            be.
          </p>
          <p>
            During this event, I met with an academic advisor who noticed that I
            didn't quite meet the requirements for admission. She informed me
            about an alternate path: retaking the ACT through the ACT Residual
            Exam, a version of the test whose score would only apply to UNLV. I
            had taken the ACT in my junior year but missed the required score by
            just one point. This was my chance to make up for that.
          </p>
          <p>
            With only two weeks to prepare, I threw myself into studying. I
            borrowed practice books from my school's library, took practice
            tests online, and focused intensely on improving my score. It was
            the first time in my life that I truly dedicated myself to achieving
            a goal.
          </p>
          <p>
            On the day of the exam, I was nervous but determined. The test was
            held on UNLV's Paradise campus, and I remember walking into the exam
            room with a handful of other students of all different ages. The
            proctor explained the process, and soon enough, the exam began. I
            did my best to stay focused but as I went through each section, I
            couldn't shake the feeling that I wasn't performing as well as I
            needed to. After completing the test I felt unsure about my
            performance and honestly quite down. I was convinced that I hadn't
            scored high enough. I called my mom the first thing after walking
            out of the building, unsure of what to say. She reassured me that
            she was proud of me for trying so hard, no matter the outcome.
          </p>
          <p>
            A week later, my score arrived in the mail. My mom was with me when
            I opened the letter. At first, I saw the scores for each section, when I
            noticed that they seemed similar to my previous attempt my heart
            sank. But then I saw the composite score: 22. It was exactly what I
            needed to be eligible for admission to UNLV. I was overwhelmed with
            excitement and relief. I immediately shared the news with my
            advisor, who was thrilled for me and helped me walk though the
            remaining steps for my admission.
          </p>
          <p>
            This experience taught me the value of perseverance and hard work.
            Since then, I've been fully committed to my studies at UNLV and I'm
            grateful for the opportunity to pursue my passion for Computer
            Science.
          </p>
          <p>
            In December 2024, I completed my Bachelors of Science
            in Computer Science at UNLV. I appreciate all the extensive knowledge 
            and experiences that I've gained. I am proud to have been
            named to the Dean's Honor List in my Fall 2023 and Spring 2024
            semesters and to have graduated with a 3.4 GPA.

          <h2>Work Experience</h2>
          <h4>2017</h4>
          <p>
            I have been working since I was 15 years old, starting with my first
            job at Carl's Jr. Over the years, I've worked in various food
            establishments, gaining valuable experience in fast-paced
            environments that require strong customer service skills. I enjoyed
            working these roles because they allowed me to interact directly
            with customers and see the immediate impact my team had on each
            order.
          </p>
          <h4>2020</h4>
          <p>
            In 2020, I started a job working at a local food truck that was
            considerate of my commitment to school. Working here allowed me to
            focus more on my studies and achieve higher grades. I'm grateful for
            this job, as it enabled me to balance work and school effectively. I
            still occasionally work and help out at the food truck, assisting
            with order management and customer service.
          </p>
          <h4>2023</h4>
          <p>
            In October 2023 I started to work part-time as a coding instructor at The Coder
            School Las Vegas. At The CoderSchool I conduct engaging coding classes for 
            small groups of 4-7 students in a classroom setting, with the focus on programming
            languages such as Python and JavaScript. I help ensure that each
            student receives personalized attention and guidance, helping them
            develop and complete lessons and coding projects with an emphasis on
            problem-solving skills and creativity.
          </p>
          <h4>2024</h4>
          <p>
            In my last semester of college, I had the opportunity to work as a
            Software Developer Intern at Banquet Consulting. During my 3 month period I
            contributed to the development of multi-tenant SaaS applications using C#, 
            AWS services (S3, Lambda, DynamoDB, API Gateway), and web technologies (JavaScript,
            Maui, Blazor). I had the privilege of working closely with a senior developer who
            was working on his own custom tech stack with the focus on serverless architecture.
            I'm grateful for this opportunity since it helped me learn a lot about
            maintaining a production environment, designing scalable solutions, leveraging 
            modern tools to streamline development, and delivering software that meets 
            client expectations.
          </p>
          <h4>2025</h4>
          <p>
            Currently, I continue to work as a coding instructor while I actively develop
            software projects (for others and myself) to continue learning new technologies,
            techniques, and gain a strong understanding about developing applications across
            the full stack. I am eager to apply the experiences I've gained and the
            knowledge I've acquired in the field of <strong>Software Development</strong> and 
            continue growing as a developer.

          <h2>Background</h2>
          <p>
            I have been facinated by coding ever since I was a child, though
            back then, I didn't even know what code was. When I was younger I
            would spend most of my time on the computer, exploring the web and
            being facinated by all the different software that was accessible. 
            My brother had introduced me to emulators and I remember downloading
            emulators for consoles like the Game Boy Advance and playing Pokemon,
            directly on the PC. Eventually I found Pokemon rom hacks and wanted
            to learn how to make custom ROMs myself. This was my
            entry point into the world of programming, where I learned about
            various tools that allowed me to make edits to Pokemon ROM files. I
            would spend a lot of time just trying to make my own games and
            learning the capabilites of these different tools. I even created a
            YouTube video demonstrating how to add a custom Pokemon Trainer to a
            ROM file.
          </p>
          <p>
            As I grew older, I discovered different software tools such as RPG
            Maker and Game Maker Studio. I spent countless hours learning these
            tools, building my problem-solving skills, and troubleshooting my
            own projects. My intreset in coding deepend in middle school with
            the discorvery of a game called Minecraft which at the time existed
            only on PC and was written in Java. This game inspired me to set up
            and customize my own Minecraft server. In the process I learned
            about Java, port forwarding, and the very basics of managing a
            server.
          </p>
          <p>
            In my freshman year of highschool I went to a magnet school where I
            took classes focused on Computer Science. This is where I gained
            foundational programming experience and finally started to
            understand the concept of code. I wrote my first programs in this
            class, including a hangman game that could pull a random word from a
            text file. This class gave me my first real exposure to coding
            concepts and working in an IDE. After that year, I returned to my
            locally zoned school for the remainder of high school years and
            didn't continue my formal studies in programming until college.
          </p>
          <p>
            At university, I continued to improve my programming skills, with
            C++ was the primary language taught in introductory courses. I began
            learning deeper concepts of programming and through various
            assignements I was expanding my skills in different areas.
          </p>
          <p>
            Since then, I have been consistently writing my own programs and
            projects, whether to solve problems, develop video games, provide a 
            business solution, or to simply practice my skills. You can find a more comprehensive list of my
            projects <a href="projects/index.html">here</a>.
