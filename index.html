					Currently pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science at the University of Nevada - Las Vegas with an expected graduation in Winter 24'. My goal is to become a software developer, and I've already begun building my skills through hands-on projects that are showcased on this site. In addition to my studies, I work as a coding instructor at The Coder School Las Vegas, where I teach coding fundamentals to small groups of students, primarily using Python. I'm eager to apply my knowledge and gain real-world experience in an entry-level software developer role or internship. Outside of academia and work, I enjoy spending time with family and friends, exploring activities like bowling, movies, and dining out. I'm committed to continuous learning and staying updated on emerging technologies to prepare for my future career.
