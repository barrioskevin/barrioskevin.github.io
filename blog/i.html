			<h1>Awful v2 (New Website!)</h1>

				<h2>Introduction</h2>
				
				<p>Hello! If you are reading this that means you have made it to my new website. I had a previous version of my website
				   but decided that it needed a new overhaul. In this post I talk about why I made a new version of my site, what's new,
				   and what to expect in the future. I am really excited to finally have this new version up and running and 
				   I can't wait to talk about the process.</p>

				<h2>Why I Made The Change</h2>
				<p>I decided to make my website (v1) in late 2023, at the time I wanted to have a professional page where I can showcase my
				   projects and previous work experience. My goal was to have my website linked in applications to positions that I would
				   apply for in hopes that employers would check out the site and get to learn more about my technical skills and experience.</p>
				<p>The original version was a one page website that had multiple sections such as about, experience, projects, skills, etc. I liked
				   the style at the time and thought that it had all the necessary information that a future employer might be looking for. However there
				   was one thing different about the previous version than in this new updated version, my orignal version was a pre-built template.</p>
				<p>When I first created the website I didn't know much about hosting a website so I looked up ways on how to host a website to get an idea
				   of how it's done. This is when I found out that you can actually host a website for free using GitHub! Once I figured out how I would 
				   host my website I then started thinking about how to build it. Because I had orignially wanted a website to showcase myself to future 
				   employers I opted to find an online template where I can have a webpage already built and then just fill in and add my personal information.</p>
				<p>While having a templated website wasn't a bad idea, and my website actually looked pretty nice, as time went on I didn't really like the feeling
				   of not having created the website myself. I don't know if it's just the inner developer in me but I really like the idea of building things on my
				   own. I also didn't like the fact that I had originally tailored my website for a professional perspective of my life, I felt that I couldn't add
				   anything to my website without maintaining a professional image so that I can seem like a good candidate for future employers.</p>
				<p>While this new site still hopes to maintain a good image and will still be shared with future employers, I wanted to make it more personal. I wanted
				   a new version of my website that was more organized and have my information spread across different pages so that if future employers do come to
				   visit they can find exactly what they need and nothing more. Most importantly I wanted to create the website myself (NO TEMPLATE).
				   So, last month I began my revamp.</p>

				<h2>What's New</h2>
				<p>Like I mentioned before, I wanted to create this new website myself so I setup a new directory on my laptop and created the standard "index.html" file
				   for my homepage. I had a vague idea of how I wanted to my website to look but when I was first getting started making the website I was more focused on
				   project structure and making sure my HTML was managable. In my index file I created a basic head section and setup the body so that I can write my info.
				   From the start I started marking each part of the home page it's own section and labeling them with id's so I can style them in the future. I used my old
				   website as a reference when filling out my the home page but I changed to a more personal tone in hopes to relate/connect with readers. Because I wanted
				   to break my new website into different pages I decided to keep my homepage as a sort of "About Me" page where I talk about who I am and my background.
				   Currently my homepage focuses on my studies at UNLV and my background from when I was younger since I haven't really gotten much further than that. In the
				   future I plan on keeping this section updated to include more relevant events in my life.</p>
				<p>After I setup my homepage I started to think about the overall styling for my website because I wanted to keep a consist style going forward with the new
				   pages that I would add. I eventually came up with the style you're seeing now but i'm open to changing it in the future as my skills and opinons evolve. Once
				   I had a style prepared for the website I began adding more pages. I started with the Contact page as it was the most simple. Here I just give out various outlets
				   so that anyone reading could reach me. I kept the style consistent and this is where I created my header component.</p>
				<p>Because the style of my website is to remain consistent across different pages I was looking for ways to make it easier to setup each page. I started by first maintaining
				   a single stylesheet that would be used for the style of each page and link them on every new page. This was a good start as it made it easier to change the look of my website
				   without having to repeat styles, but I needed something for my header. The header is the top part of the webpage that displays my name and links to the different pages on my
				   website. When I was building the first couple pages of my site I was copying and pasting the header used in the homepage to each new page. I knew there had to be
				   a better way and after a little research I found a clean way to import HTML to a page using JavaScript. I created a HTML file in my project directory that contained just my
				   header, I also created another stylesheet to go along with this file and only focus on styling the header. I then created a JavaScript file that is responsible for filing
				   in a div labeled "header-component" with all the HTML content of my header file. Now all I needed to do to add my header to a new page is to link the stylesheet and script.
				   This made adding new sections easier and I started to work on my Projects section.</p>
				<p>In v1 of my website everything was on one page, I had a section for projects in this page where I gave a brief description of the project and a little screenshot/demo. I liked
				   this approach but I feel like I was limited with one page and adding to much text would get readers lost. In my new version of my website I wanted to have a project page where
				   each my project's would be listed and you can click on them to see my post about the project. I plan on going more in depth with my descriptions and talking more about
				   my experience creating my projects. I made a folder in my project directory called "projects" where I plan to put all my pages related to my projects in. At the time of writing
				   this I only managed to write an entry for one project but I plan on adding more in the future improving on my explanations and presentation.</p>
				<p>After having created my homepage, contact page, and project page all that was left was to add in my blog page. I was really excited to add in a blog section to my website
				   because I've always wanted a place to express my thoughts and ideas. I still don't know if I want to keep the blog technical or write about all sorts of topics, I figure I will
				   figure out what to write about as I go. The process for making my blog section was similar to making my project section I created a folder called "blog" and added in the
				   necessary pages. I figured the first post should be me talking about the new updated site but I plan on updating the page with new posts as frequently as I can.</p>

				<h2>Moving Forward</h2>
				<p>Having created this new website myself I hope to treat it differently then my previous version. I want to keep this website updated and consistently add new blog
				   and project posts. Updates to the site are also certain to take place and I'm excited to make and talk about any changes that I come up with.</p>
				<p>I hope that in the future as I keep maintaining this website my technical skills imporve as well as my writing. Writing more frequently will help me improve 
				   my communication skills, which I've always had trouble with.</p>
				<p>With the new school semester starting I plan to update the site with new posts as frequently as I can. I plan on sharing my experiences that I have throughout
				   my semester and any intersting things I learn. I'm aiming to have new blog posts up weekly. Also, if you notice any grammar/spelling mistakes across this site 
				   bear with me because I am writing this entire site in HTML using vim, so as of right now I haven't implemented proper spell checking.</p>
				<p>As always I'm open to any suggestions, comments, or remarks about this website (or anything in general). Feel free to contact me with any opinions (especially
				   if you have any advice on HTML/CSS/JavaScript).</p>
				<p>Thank you for taking the time to read this post. I hope you come back and visit again to see how my website evolves!</p>

				<small><em>Oh, If you were ever questioning the title of this post "Awful v2", it's because I started to use the name "Awful" as a display name across the internet. I'm
				       not really sure why (maybe I will post about it in the future) but I also decided to give that name to the project of my website. You know, all projects have
				       code names.</em></small>
